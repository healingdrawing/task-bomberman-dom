## dev recommendations:  
- do not use `zero` branch (it will be used finally)  
- create your branches from `dev` branch  
- name your own branches , f.e. `your-name-something` and work there  
- before make pull request to merge your changes to `dev` branch, create new branch `merge-to-dev-your-name-something`  
- create pull request to `merge-to-dev-your-name-something` from branch `your-name-something`  
- resolve any conflicts, and merge, now branch `merge-to-dev-your-name-something` ready to be merged to `dev`  
- create pull requests to `dev` branch, to merge your results into project  
- `dev` will be merged into `zero` branch, close to release  
---
- if you use more than one machine, press vscode `Synchronize Changes` button, every time you start new coding session, to decrease difficulties to push changes later. Extra conflict resolving can be extra headache, and always a potential way to make more mistakes. Even if it is your branch you can forget something accedentally.
