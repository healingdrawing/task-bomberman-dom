## Recommendations
- do not use `zero` branch (it will be used finally)
- follow the folder tree from `dev` branch(or create your branch from `dev`)
- create your own branches , f.e. `your-name-something` and work there
- create pull requests to `dev` branch, to merge your results into project
- `dev` will be merged into `zero` branch, close to release
---
- if you use more than one machine, press vscode `Synchronize Changes` button, every time you start new coding session, to decrease difficulties to push changes later. Extra conflict resolving can be extra headache, and always a potential way to make more mistakes. Even if it is your branch you can forget something accedentally.
